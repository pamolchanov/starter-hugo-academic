<!-- I am a distinguished research scientist and team manager with [NVIDIA Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/) since 2015. My research is focused on efficient deep learning and human-centric computer vision in LPR team lead by [Jan Kautz](https://jankautz.com). Since 2023, I am leading a research team on efficient deep learning with the focus on model compression, NAS like acceleration, novel architectures, and adaptive/conditional inference.
 <!-- In the area of human-centric vision I am working on face/body/hand landmarks and pose estimation, action/gesture recognition and designing novel human-computer interaction systems.  -->

<!-- I obtained PhD from Tampere University of Technology, Finland in the area of signal processing in 2014 supervised by [Karen Eguiazarian](https://www.tuni.fi/en/karen-eguiazarian). I received my master degree from National Aerospace University, Kharkiv, Ukraine in Radio Systems focusing on high-order spectrum techniques for signal processing and mentored by [Alexander Totsky](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391220000). -->
<!-- # My dissertation was focused on designing automatic target recognition systems for radars and general radar signal processing. During PhD studies I was honored to receive EuRAD best paper award in 2011 and EuRAD young engineer award in 2013. -->

<!-- We always look for promising interns and full time positions, feel free to ping me for details. I am also interested in connecting with people who share similar research interests.  -->

I am a Distinguished Research Scientist and Team Manager at [NVIDIA Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/). I work in the LPR team led by [Jan Kautz](https://jankautz.com), focusing on efficient deep learning and human-centric computer vision. Since 2023, I have been leading a research team dedicated to efficient deep learning, specifically in the areas of model compression, NAS-like acceleration, novel architectures, and adaptive/conditional inference. Currently we are primary focused on LLM and vision-language models. 

I earned my PhD from Tampere University of Technology, Finland in 2014, specializing in signal processing under the supervision of [Karen Eguiazarian](https://www.tuni.fi/en/karen-eguiazarian). Prior to that, I obtained my master's degree from the National Aerospace University in Kharkiv, Ukraine. My master's research centered around radio systems, with a focus on high-order spectrum techniques for signal processing, mentored by [Alexander Totsky](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391220000).

We are always on the lookout for promising interns and full-time positions in the area of LLM and VLM efficiency. Feel free to reach out to me for more details. I am also interested in connecting with individuals who share similar research interests.
