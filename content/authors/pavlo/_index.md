I am a principal research scientist and research lead with [NVIDIA Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/) since 2015. My research is focused on efficient deep learning and human-centric computer vision in LPR team lead by [Jan Kautz](https://jankautz.com). In the area of network efficiency I am interested in methods for model acceleration, inversion, novel architectures and adaptive/conditional inference. In the area of human-centric vision I am working on face/body/hand landmarks and pose estimation, action/gesture recognition and designing novel human-computer interaction systems. 

I obtained PhD from Tampere University of Technology, Finland in the area of signal processing in 2014 supervised by [Karen Eguiazarian](https://www.tuni.fi/en/karen-eguiazarian). My dissertation was focused on designing automatic target recognition systems for radars and general radar signal processing. During PhD studies I was honored to receive EuRAD best paper award in 2011 and EuRAD young engineer award in 2013. I received my master degree from National Aerospace University, Kharkiv, Ukraine in Radio Systems focusing on high-order spectrum techniques for signal processing and mentored by [Alexander Totsky](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391220000).

We always look for promising interns and full time positions, feel free to ping me for details. I am also interested in connecting with people who share similar research interests.
